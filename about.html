<p> About Me
    <br></br>
        Hi readers, I'm Mohith and I'm a student studying at Sri Amogha Junior College(SAJC). I'm an ambivert
    and I love to code a lot well by this you may have understood that I'm a workaholic and I'm a caffeine 
    addict. My interest and hobbies are eating, Playing mobile gamesm, reading fictional and non-fictional 
    books, making silk handicrafts and many more. I'm a man of few words and I never beat around the bush. I 
    have a really good taste in many things like clothing, perfumes and more. My ambition is to become 
    an Application Devoloper(App DEV) or to reach into a more higher position.
